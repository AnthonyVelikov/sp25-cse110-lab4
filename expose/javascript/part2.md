1. at line 12 will print 3 becuase that was the last value assigned to i

2. at line 13 the consle will print 150 becuase that was the last value assigned to discountedprice

3. will print 150 becuase that was the last value assigned to finalprice

4. returns array of final prices discounted

5. i is not defined outisde of the for loop

6. once again discountedprice is not defined outisde of the for loop

7. will print 150 becuase that was the last value assigned to finalprice

8. returns array of final prices discounted

9.  i is not defined outisde of the for loop

10. at line 12 will print 3 becuase that was the last value assigned to length

11. returns the array discounted 

12. a. student.name
    b. student['Grad Year']
    c. student.greeting();
    d. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    e.student.courseLoad[0]


13. a. 32 bc the 2 is concatenated to the 3
    b. - only works numerically so 3-2 =1
    c. null is 0 so 3+ 0 = 3
    d. null is concatenated to 3 so 3null
    e. 1 + 3 = 4 bc true is 1
    f. botha are 0 numerically so 0+0 = 0 
    g. undefined is concatenated to 3 so 3undefined
    h. 3 is converted to a number and undefined is converted to NaN. 3 - NaN = NaN

14. a. '2' is converted to a number so returns true
    b. returns false bc a comparison between strings and 2 comes after 1 in strings. 
    c. returns true '2' is converted to a number
    d. false bc === checks the type
    e. false bc true is 1
    f. returns true bc any nonzero number is true. 

15. ==  converts types and === no type convertion

16. see part2-question16.js

17. [2, 4, 6] basically this function takes in an array and function then returns what the function does to each element of the array. in this case it doubles everything
